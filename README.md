# 🌳 Story Maker 🗨️

Welcome to the most exciting project since sliced bread got an upgrade to toasted! 🍞✨

## What's This All About?

Imagine you're a game developer, and you want your NPCs to have more personality than a cardboard cutout. Or maybe you're writing a choose-your-own-adventure story and don't want to end up in a tangled mess of sticky notes and string. Well, fear not! The Story Maker is here to save the day! 🦸‍♀️

This nifty tool lets you create, edit, and playback branching dialog systems faster than you can say "To be, or not to be, that is the... wait, what were the other options?" 🤔

But wait, there's more! 📢 The Story Maker isn't just for games and books. Here are some other exciting uses:

- Create interactive training scenarios for your company (because PowerPoint presentations are so last century)
- Design complex conversations that don't end up in an infinite loop of "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that" 🤖
- Craft the ultimate "Convince Your Partner to Get a Pet" strategy, complete with rebuttals for every objection 🐶🐱

Whether you're a developer, writer, trainer, or just someone who likes to be prepared for every conversational twist and turn, the Story Maker has got you covered!

## Tech Stack (or as we like to call it, "The Tower of Babel")

- Backend: AWS CDK (Because who doesn't love a good cloud pun?)
- Frontend: Vite (It's like a vitamin shot for your React app!)
- Excitement: 100% (Not technically part of the stack, but important nonetheless)

## Getting Started

### Backend (CDK) Setup

1. Make sure you have the AWS CLI and CDK installed. If not, no worries! Just follow these steps:

   ```
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   aws configure
   ```

   (Pro tip: Don't use "password123" as your AWS secret key. We tried. It doesn't work.)

2. Navigate to the `cdk` directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   cdk deploy
   ```
   Sit back and watch as the cloud does your bidding. ☁️🔮

### Frontend (Vite) Setup

1. Head over to the `frontend` directory (it's like a magic portal, but with less swirling vortexes):

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. If you see a blank page, don't panic! It's not a existential void, it's just React doing its thing.

## Features

- Create branching dialogs so complex, they'll make a choose-your-own-adventure book jealous
- Edit your dialog trees with the precision of a squirrel organizing its nut collection
- Playback your creations and pretend you're in control of the universe (at least, this tiny part of it)

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add a feature? Just want to tell us how awesome we are? Open an issue or submit a PR! We promise we don't bite (unless you're a bug, then all bets are off).

## Final Words

Remember, with great dialog comes great responsibility. Use this power wisely, and may your NPCs never run out of things to say! 🎭🚀

Yes, I let the AI write this README, sorry.
